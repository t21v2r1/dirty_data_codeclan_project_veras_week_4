##1.  QUESTION: What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values). ANSWER: 589884

```{r}
candy_analysis_ratings <- candy_analysis %>%
    select(-c("year","age","are_you_trick_or_treating","gender",
              "country", 'internal_id'))
   sum(!is.na(candy_analysis_ratings))
```
##2. What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating? 
#for this question, we limited a possible number of years by 100 years (because some people joked that they are 1880 years old etc)
#ANSWER: 35 (rounded)
##3. What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating? ANSWER: 39 (rounded), PS: see comment above.
```{r}
av_age_trick_or_treating <- candy_analysis %>%
group_by(are_you_trick_or_treating) %>%
    filter(age <= 100) %>%
         summarise(average_age = mean(age,na.rm= TRUE))
av_age_trick_or_treating
    
names(candy_analysis)
```
##4 For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?
#answers: see in the code

```{r}
candy_totals <- candy_analysis_ratings %>%
      gather("candy_bar","ratings") %>%
        group_by(candy_bar, ratings) %>% 
  count(ratings, name = "total") %>%
       arrange(desc(`total`))
head(filter(candy_totals, ratings == "DESPAIR")) 
head(filter(candy_totals, ratings == "JOY"))
head(filter(candy_totals, ratings == "MEH"))

```

#```{r}
#filter(candy_analysis, gender == "Male") %>% count() 
#filter(candy_analysis, gender == "Female") %>% count() 
#
#```

##How many people rated Starburst as despair? ANSWER: 1990
```{r}
filter(candy_analysis, starburst == "DESPAIR") %>% 
  count() 
```

#What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset ?
